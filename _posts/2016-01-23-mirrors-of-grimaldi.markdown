**Mirrors of Grimald** is a four player splitscreen game where your health is represented by the size of your screen. Players will be pitted against each other as Grimaldi's Interdimensional Demonic Carnival invades the same medieval town in parallel timelines. As swarms of demonic minions attack the players, their screens will shrink and eventually crush them, knocking them out of the game. The last surviving player is declared the winner and is allowed to fight another day.

Splitscreen is at the forefront of Mirrors of Grimaldi and how players interact with our dynamically changing splitscreen will determine who is victorious in this competitive multiplayer experience. The Player main weapon is the ability to punch minions into enemy players screens, who will then target and attack your opponents instead of you. With thrilling and strategic gameplay, Mirrors of Grimaldi brings a fresh new face to local multiplayer that will keep hardcore and casual gamers alike asking for another rematch.

**My Roles**:
I primarily focused on developing an AI framework that allowed for utility-based decision making, but I also worked on all aspects of the enemies, including: movement and path-finding, attacks and the attack system, perception and targeting. Outside of that, I developed various stencil shaders, interfaced many of the systems mentioned above to work with the player, and various major and minor bug fixes outside of the AI framework.
