**SpongeBob SquarePants™: The Patrick Star Game** is a four player split-screen game where your health is represented by the size of your screen. Players will be pitted against each other as Grimaldi's Interdimensional Demonic Carnival invades the same medieval town in parallel timelines. As swarms of demonic minions attack the players, their screens will shrink and eventually crush them, knocking them out of the game. The last surviving player is declared the winner and is allowed to fight another day.

**Split-screen** is at the forefront of SpongeBob SquarePants™: The Patrick Star Game and how players interact with our dynamically changing split-screen will determine who is victorious in this competitive multiplayer experience. The Player main weapon is the ability to punch minions into enemy players screens, who will then target and attack your opponents instead of you. With thrilling and strategic gameplay, SpongeBob SquarePants™: The Patrick Star Game brings a fresh new face to local multiplayer that will keep hardcore and casual gamers alike asking for another rematch.

**My Roles**:
I primarily focused on developing an AI framework that allowed for utility-based decision making, but I also worked on all aspects of the enemies, including movement and path-finding, attacks and the attack system, perception and targeting. Outside of that, I developed various stencil shaders, interfaced many of the systems mentioned above to work with the player, and various major and minor bug fixes outside of the AI framework.

**Awards**:

This was our senior project while at Drexel University, which according to the Princeton review is a top ten school for game design. Every year Intel hosts a competition at GDC in San Francisco, where each of those schools sends 1 team to represent them in hopes to take hope either best in gameplay or art. A few months before GDC, Drexel held an internal competition to see who would represent the school. Because of our unique gameplay and art design, where we won the internal. While at GDC we set up a booth for people to check out the game, and it was extremely well received. Finally, the big night came and after hours of anxiety, they announced the winners! Tune in below to see what happened (a lot of awkward standing)!

![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

Hi, I’m **Alex**, a passionate software engineer at **PHL Collective** with over six years of experience in the video game industry. I specialize in cross-platform development, build pipeline automation, and performance optimization, but I’m always eager to take on any task that contributes to a project’s success.

I’ve had the opportunity to wear many hats as a software engineer in games, and I enjoy exploring different aspects of development. Whether it’s graphics rendering in C++ with low-level APIs like DirectX 12, NVN, Agc, or Gnm, automating build pipelines with Jenkins using Groovy and Python, or implementing core game mechanics, I’m always ready to dive in and take on new challenges.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with artists, designers, producers, writers, audio engineers, and fellow programmers to ship nine titles across multiple platforms. I’ve developed the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously while keeping deadlines on track. Each project brought its own unique challenges—some straightforward, others complex—and through teamwork and dedication, I’m proud to have played a role in their successful launches.

As I continue to grow, I’m excited to bring my experience and passion to future projects by creating engaging experiences, solving complex technical problems, and collaborating with talented people to deliver fun games.
