**Mirrors of Grimaldi** is a four player split-screen game where your health is represented by the size of your screen. Players will be pitted against each other as Grimaldi's Interdimensional Demonic Carnival invades the same medieval town in parallel timelines. As swarms of demonic minions attack the players, their screens will shrink and eventually crush them, knocking them out of the game. The last surviving player is declared the winner and is allowed to fight another day.

**Split-screen** is at the forefront of Mirrors of Grimaldi and how players interact with our dynamically changing split-screen will determine who is victorious in this competitive multiplayer experience. The Player main weapon is the ability to punch minions into enemy players screens, who will then target and attack your opponents instead of you. With thrilling and strategic gameplay, Mirrors of Grimaldi brings a fresh new face to local multiplayer that will keep hardcore and casual gamers alike asking for another rematch.

**Awards**:

This was our senior project at Drexel University, a top ten school for game design according to the Princeton Review. Each year, Intel hosts a competition at GDC in San Francisco, where top game design schools send one team to compete for the best in gameplay or art. A few months before GDC, Drexel held an internal competition to select their representative. Thanks to our unique gameplay and art design, we won the internal competition and were flown out to San Francisco. At GDC, we set up a booth to showcase our game, and it was extremely well received. Finally, the big night arrived, and after hours of anxious anticipation, the winners were announced! Tune in below to see what happened (a lot of awkward standing)!
