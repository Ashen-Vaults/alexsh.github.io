I'm a software engineer who graduated from Drexel University in 2016 with a bachelors in computer science and concentrations in artificial intelligence for games and human-computer interaction.

Most of my programming career has been as a Unity developer creating educational and philanthropic games at Skyless Game Studios, but recently data science has become my passion. The power that data has to shape the world is humbling and I love the idea of using AI to benefit people. During my journey into data science, I look forward to learning something new every day.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
