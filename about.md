Hi, I’m **Alex**, a passionate software engineer at **PHL Collective** with over six years of experience in the video game industry. I specialize in cross-platform development, build pipeline automation, and performance optimization, but I’m always eager to take on any task that contributes to a project’s success.

I’ve had the opportunity to wear many hats as a software engineer in games, and I enjoy exploring different aspects of development. Whether it’s graphics rendering in C++ with low-level APIs like DirectX 12, NVN, Agc, or Gnm, automating build pipelines with Jenkins using Groovy and Python, or implementing core game mechanics, I’m always ready to dive in and take on new challenges.

Throughout my career, I've collaborated closely with artists, designers, producers, writers, audio engineers, and fellow programmers to ship nine titles across multiple platforms. Each project brought its own unique challenges—some straightforward, others complex—and through teamwork and dedication, I’m proud to have contributed to their successful launches.

As I continue to grow, I’m excited to bring my experience and passion to future projects by creating engaging experiences, solving complex technical problems, and collaborating with talented people to deliver fun games.
