I’m **Alex**, a passionate software engineer at **PHL Collective** with over 6 years of experience in the video game industry, specializing in cross-platform development, build pipeline automation, and performance optimization. I’ve worn many hats and quickly pick up new technologies—whether it’s graphics rendering in C++ with low-level APIs like DirectX 12, NVN, Agc, and Gnm, or automating build pipelines with Groovy and Python, and anything in between. When faced with a challenge, I don’t just find solutions—I make them work.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate closely with artists, designers, producers, writers, audio engineers, and fellow programmers to successfully ship 9 titles across multiple platforms. Each project presented its own unique challenges—some straightforward, others complex—and through teamwork and dedication, we achieved successful launches every time.

I’ve excelled in both in-person and remote settings, and I find that remote work, in particular, allows me to focus deeply on my tasks and deliver high-quality results. Looking forward, I’m excited to continue creating engaging experiences, driving innovation, and tackling new challenges in game development.
