<p>Hi, I'm Alex. I graduated from Drexel University in June 2016 with a bachelors in Computer Science with concentrations in Artifical Intelligence for Games and HCI. I'm primarly a Unity Developer (C#) who likes to get away with functional programming whenever I get a chance.
<a href="/project/2016/05/23/mirrors-of-grimaldi/">Some of the games I've worked on have even won awards!</a></p>

<p>Along with game programming, I am interested in data science, and more 
specifically bioinformatics. I'm still relatively new to the field, but am currently taking some courses on Machine Learning, Genomic Data Science, and recently just finished a course on Statistics, so expect blog posts and projects in the very near future</p>
