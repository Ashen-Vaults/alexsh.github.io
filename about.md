I’m **Alex**, a passionate software engineer with over 6 years in the video game industry, specializing in cross-platform development, build pipeline automation, and performance optimization. I’ve worn many hats and quickly pick up new technologies—from graphics rendering with low-level APIs to build pipeline automation with Groovy and Python. When faced with a challenge, I don’t just find solutions—I make them work.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate closely with artists, designers, producers, writers, audio engineers, and fellow programmers to successfully ship nine titles across multiple platforms. Each project has presented its own set of unique challenges—some straightforward, others complex—and through teamwork and dedication, we achieved successful launches every time.

I’ve excelled in both in-person and remote settings, and I find that remote work, in particular, allows me to focus deeply on my tasks and deliver high-quality results. I’m excited to continue creating engaging experiences and tackling new challenges in game development.
